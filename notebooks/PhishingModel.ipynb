    "## Hugging Face: Phishing Classification Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab/demo, we are going to use a pre-trained AI classification model for email phishing. This model is able to\n",
    "injest text or html data, and classify it as either \"benign\" or \"phishing\". This pre-trained model leverages BERT from Google\n",
    "which was trained in 2018. The concept of leveraging BERT, a natural language processing (NLP) model, and extending the training for \n",
    "a specific task is known as **transfer learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that a tremendous amount of the statistical and mathematical operations needed to build and use AI models are being abstracted away when you use a pre-trained model interface/API. This is actually a good thing for us, as training your own model is a specialized skill that requires some understanding of the underlying statistical theory, and even better, an understanding of the underlying linear algebra that is commonly used for all vector based computational neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common concept in natural language processing (NLP) is the idea of **tokenizing**. In it's simplest form, **tokenizing** is a process whereby string tokens (words or individual characters) are turned into mathematical vectors, otherwize known as matricies for ease of numerical computation. Since either words, or sentences do not have a fixed length, and a fixed two dimensional array (matrix) does have a limit, then we often are in the situation of truncating or padding data when performing the **tokenizing** process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first Jupyter notebook cell, we use the huggingface_hub, and transformers Python modules. Both are designed to facilitate the download and use of pre-trained AI models. Some points to note as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**huggingface_hub.snapshot_download()**](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.24.2/en/package_reference/file_download#huggingface_hub.snapshot_download) is used to download a snapshot of the entire AI model repository.\n",
    "* [**transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.43.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained) is used to create a text tokenizer object from a pre-trained model.\n",
    "* [**transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained()**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.43.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification) is used to create a model object from which predictions can be made.\n",
    "* [**transformers.pipeline()**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines) is a very high level powerful functional abstraction that allows you to feed input data to an AI model for a prediction without the complex statistical API calls which are being used within the pipeline() abstraction.\n",
    "    * Please note the function argument **device='mps'** is included so that the pipeline leverages the MacOS MPS GPU core for processing.\n",
    " \n",
    "### **bert-finetuned-phishing** Model Accuracy Claims\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the hugging face published document, this model achieves the following results on the evaluation dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loss: 0.1953\n",
    "* Accuracy: 0.9717\n",
    "* Precision: 0.9658\n",
    "* Recall: 0.9670\n",
    "* False Positive Rate: 0.0249\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Goals\n",

    "Analyze the original training dataset, and evaluate from an alternative dataset whether this accuracy claim seems\n",
    "correct to us. \n"

    "* [**pd.read_csv()**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) is commonly used to read and process comma delimited data.

    "* [**pd.dropna()**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html) is used to drop any rows with NULL data in the dataframe. Using **inplace=True** allows us to mutate the dataframe inplace rather than having to assign the result to a new object.\n",
    "* [**pd.replace()**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.replace.html) is a very useful function for searching and replace data in an entire dataframe. It can perform simple string replacement or even use regular expressions if you have the need for more complex operations.\n",
